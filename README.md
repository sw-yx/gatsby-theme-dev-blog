here lie all the failed attempts i've made to make gatsby-theme-dev-blog

v1 was an attempt to convert overreacted.io to GTDB. its not a workspace. abandoned to try gatsby theme blog.

v2 was an attempt to use gatsby-theme-blog. its a nice yarn workspace. abandoned because shadowing sucked.

v3 is where we finally get it right! we are basing on https://github.com/eggheadio/gatsby-theme-egghead-blog
