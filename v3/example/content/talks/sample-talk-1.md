desc: An introduction to Babel Macros and how they can solve DX vs UX tradeoffs
description: Babel macros are a new way to solve DX and UX tradeoffs by metaprogramming to write code the way that is best for you while delivering code that is best for the user. Case in point, JSX - but why stop there? In this talk we explore how I wrote babel-blade to solve the double declaration problem in clientside GraphQL libraries, and how to get started writing your first babel macro!
cfp: Hi organizers! Babel is a core part of the JS ecosystem, and I think still very underexplored/underappreciated because of the perception that it is hard to get into and limited to transpiling JSX and TC39 proposals. With the increasing adoption of babel-plugin-macros (adopted by large ecosystems like React) the addressable space for babel has -exploded-. Essentially making it possible to move computation and metaprogramming from run time to build time making for faster apps -and- a better developer experience! I want to tell the world!!
